# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó Living Infrastructure Chatbot

This chatbot was developed for [Spherical.io ](https://spherical.studio/). It ingests data from notion pages and indexes into FAISS vector DB. 

The app leverages LangChain's streaming support and async API to update the page in real time for multiple users.

## ‚úÖ Running locally
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `ingest.sh` to ingest LangChain docs data into the vectorstore (only needs to be done once).
   1. You can use other [Document Loaders](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/document_loaders.html) to load your own data into the vectorstore.
3. Run the app: `make start`
4. Open [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in your browser.


Question-Answering has the following steps, all handled by [ChatVectorDBChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/chains/combine_docs_examples/chat_vector_db.html):

1. Given the chat history and new user input, determine what a standalone question would be (using GPT-3).
2. Given that standalone question, look up relevant documents from the vectorstore.
3. Pass the standalone question and relevant documents to GPT-3 to generate a final answer.
